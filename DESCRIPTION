Title: Calculate Incremental Area Under the Curve
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Sally K. Slipher [aut,cre]
Maintainer: Sally K. Slipher <sallyslipher@montana.edu>
Description: Calculate an incremental trapezoidal area under the curve for
    biomarkers measured at a series of time points, with the first
    timepoint being a baseline measurement. This is a summary measure that
    captures the total magnitude of a response over a specified time
    interval; it is an estimate of total concentration.
