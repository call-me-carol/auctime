The goal of `auctime` is to provide an easy and reproducible way of
calculating incremental area under the curve calculations (iAUC) for
biomarkers which have measurements taken over at intervals over time.
This quantity represents the effect of a treatment on the total
concentration of a biomarker.

This is different from the AUC that results from calculation of area
under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which represents
the accuracy of binary classifier.

## Installation

You can install the `auctime` package from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("scrs-msu/auctime")

library(auctime)
```

## Methods

Several methods are included in calcAUC to find the area under the
curve. All methods of calculation use the trapezoidal rule to
interpolate between data points.

-   `positive` sums area that is above the baseline (first) measurement,
    ignoring any area below the baseline (Wolever & Jenkins, 1986)

-   `net` subtracts the area below baseline from the area above baseline
    (Le Floch et al., 1990)

-   `total` is the area with respect to ground (a baseline of 0)

## Example

Data should be labeled with the biomarker name and timepoint in the
format `Biomarker_Time`, with subjectsâ€™ measurements in rows:

``` r
set.seed(1234)

measurements <- data.frame(Biomarker_0 = rnorm(10,50,20),
                           Biomarker_1 = rnorm(10,70,20),
                           Biomarker_2 = rnorm(10,90,20),
                           Biomarker_3 = rnorm(10,90,20),
                           Biomarker_4 = rnorm(10,70,20),
                           Biomarker_5 = rnorm(10,60,20))

```

Use `calcAUC()` to calculate area under the curve:

``` r
output <- calcAUC(data = measurements)
```

`calcAUC()` produces output containing input data and arguments,
subject-wise calculations and plots, a data frame of calculations, and a
plot grid of all subjects:

``` r
output$input

output$subjects

output$dataframe

output$multiplot
```
